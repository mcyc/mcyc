## Hi there!

**I'm a data scientist** in Toronto, Ontario, with 8+ years of experience translating complex data into actionable insights. As a former PhD astrophysicist, I specialize in causal inference, optimization, machine learning, and data storytelling.

### Featured Projects
- [**Flight Price Prediction**](https://github.com/mcyc/predictive-ml/tree/main/flight-price): An XGBoost-based model for forecasting airline ticket prices using custom feature engineering.
- [**MUFASA**](https://github.com/mcyc/mufasa): An automated ML solution for modeling 3D spectral imaging data in astrophysics.
- [**CRISPy**](https://github.com/mcyc/crispy): A Python package for identifying density ridges in N-dimensional images using unsupervised ML.
- [**InsightAtlas**](https://github.com/mcyc/InsightAtlas): A geospatial dashboard for behavioral segmentation and neighborhood ranking across Canada.

### Skills
- **Programming**: Python (pandas, scikit-learn), SQL  
- **Machine Learning**: XGBoost, Random Forest, Clustering  
- **Deployment**: Docker, Git, distributed computing (Dask)
